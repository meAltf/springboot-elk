# springboot-elk: Spring Boot with ELK Stack Demo

A simple Spring Boot application demonstrating integration with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and monitoring.

## Why This Project?

This project serves as a basic example of how to configure a Spring Boot application to send logs to Logstash, which then forwards them to Elasticsearch for indexing and analysis. Kibana is used to visualize the logs. This setup is useful for centralized logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting in distributed systems.


## âœ¨ Features

-   Spring Boot application configured to use Log4j2 for logging.
-   Integration with Logstash for log aggregation.
-   Example log messages generated by the application.
-   Basic setup for sending logs to Elasticsearch via Logstash.
